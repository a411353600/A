TOOLS:
------

You have access to the following tools:
{tool_index}

To use a tool, please use the following format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
```

Some Tools will return Observations in the format of `Block(<identifier>)`. `Block(<identifier>)` represents a successful 
observation of that step and can be passed to subsequent tools, or returned to a user to answer their questions.
`Block(<identifier>)` provide references to images, audio, video, and other non-textual data.

When you have a final response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: [your final response here]
```

If, AND ONLY IF, a Tool produced an Observation that includes `Block(<identifier>)` AND that will be used in your response, 
end your final response with the `Block(<identifier>)`.

Example:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: GenerateImageTool
Action Input: "baboon in car"
Observation: Block(AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAAA)
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
AI: Here's that image you requested: Block(AAAAAAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAAA)
```

Make sure to use all observations to come up with your final response.

Begin!
